Previous update had plenty of ^D signs maybe because I tried to use cat command from windows cmd instead of Git Bash

- Playing with flex was very good to realize how it works. It helped to understand the positioning and behaviour of a flex container
- I also got some practice with Bash and cat command. Some more practise is needed :)
  
- Adding text to existing file with cat. Created a search input area. Next task is to make a flex navibar
